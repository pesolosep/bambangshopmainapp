## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

- Because in the case of Bambangshop where there is no different behaviors amoing the subscribers, then we can assume that on this module there is only one type of subscriber and or every subscriber's behaviors are the same. Hence why, an interface is not needed and a single model struct fits well for the Bambangshop.

2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

- Using DashMap is necessary in my opinion because by using the subscriber id as the key to the value in the dict, it will be easier to compile and search for a specific subscriber object, which in our module, would happen often. So using Vec will take longer to find a specific subscriber object and not sufficient for our module case.

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

- In this scenario, using both singleton pattern and a DashMap are essential as they complement each other. The singleton ensures that only one instance exists across a single interface, while the DashMap guarantees that the data for subscribers remains safe for concurrent use by different threads.


#### Reflection Publisher-2

1. In the Model-View Controller (MVC) compound pattern, there is no “Service” and “Repository”. Model in MVC covers both data storage and business logic. Explain based on your understanding of design principles, why we need to separate “Service” and “Repository” from a Model?

- In my opinion, services and repositories should be separated from the model to enhance readability and facilitate changes. If all three functionalities are merged into one file, it becomes overly lengthy and difficult to comprehend. Separating them into their respective files makes each file more accessible and easier to modify.

2. What happens if we only use the Model? Explain your imagination on how the interactions between each model (Program, Subscriber, Notification) affect the code complexity for each model?

- Utilizing only a model, by combining services and repositories into one file, leads to poor readability. Moreover, with three models in play — program, subscriber, and notification — the file would become extremely long and challenging to navigate. This complexity in reading also impacts the difficulty of altering or tweaking the code when changes are necessary.

3. Have you explored more about Postman? Tell us how this tool helps you to test your current work. You might want to also list which features in Postman you are interested in or feel like it is helpful to help your Group Project or any of your future software engineering projects.

- Postman is a tool used for testing the APIs of a project. I find Postman immensely useful for API testing because of its features, such as the ability to make requests with various tokens or body requests, customize the environment for a collection, and the inclusion of monitoring features.
